This is the final project of Intermediate HTML &amp; CSS where we put into practice mixing Grid &amp; Flexbox together. 

The project instructions encourage us to make our own design, honestly, I think the real challenge lies in recreating the already existing layout and design. Afterwards, I may customize things like colors, pictures, etc. But keep the same layout and content.
